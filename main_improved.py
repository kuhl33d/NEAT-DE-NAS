# Define the data, the problem, and the objective function
# For this example, we will use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits as the data
# The problem is to classify the images of digits into 10 classes (0 to 9)
# The objective function is to maximize the accuracy, minimize the complexity, and maximize the diversity of the neural network
# We will use the following weights and sub-objectives for the objective function
w1 = 0.5 # weight for accuracy
w2 = 0.3 # weight for complexity
w3 = 0.2 # weight for diversity

# Load the MNIST dataset and split it into training and testing sets
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train / 255.0 # normalize the pixel values
x_test = x_test / 255.0 # normalize the pixel values
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, 10) # convert the labels to one-hot vectors
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, 10) # convert the labels to one-hot vectors

# Define the neural network encoding
# For this example, we will use a variable-length string of symbols that encode the structure, weights, and activation functions of the neural network
# The symbols are:
# - input: the input layer with 784 nodes (28 x 28 pixels)
# - output: the output layer with 10 nodes (10 classes)
# - dense: a fully connected layer with a random number of nodes between 1 and 100
# - conv: a convolutional layer with a random number of filters between 1 and 32, a random kernel size between 1 and 5, and a random stride between 1 and 3
# - pool: a pooling layer with a random pool size between 1 and 3, and a random stride between 1 and 3
# - flatten: a layer that flattens the input into a one-dimensional vector
# - relu: a rectified linear unit activation function
# - sigmoid: a sigmoid activation function
# - tanh: a hyperbolic tangent activation function
# - softmax: a softmax activation function
# - dropout: a dropout layer with a random dropout rate between 0 and 0.5
# - batchnorm: a batch normalization layer
# - skip: a skip connection that adds the output of the previous layer to the input of the next layer
# - concat: a concatenation layer that concatenates the output of the previous layer with the input of the next layer
# - end: a symbol that marks the end of the neural network

# Initialize a random population of neural networks
# For this example, we will use a population size of 10
pop_size = 10 # population size
pop = [] # population list
symbols = ["input", "output", "dense", "conv", "pool", "flatten", "relu", "sigmoid", "tanh", "softmax", "dropout", "batchnorm", "skip", "concat", "end"] # list of symbols
for i in range(pop_size):
  nn = [] # neural network list
  nn.append("input") # add the input layer
  while True:
    s = np.random.choice(symbols) # choose a random symbol
    nn.append(s) # add the symbol to the neural network
    if s == "end": # if the symbol is end, break the loop
      break
  pop.append(nn) # add the neural network to the population

# Define the evolutionary algorithm
# For this example, we will use a simple genetic algorithm with the following parameters and operators
pop_size = 10 # population size
mut_rate = 0.1 # mutation rate
cross_rate = 0.9 # crossover rate
sel_method = "tournament" # selection method
fit_func = "expected_value" # fitness function

# Define the probabilistic model
# For this example, we will use a Bayesian network that encodes the probability distributions of the neural network components and connections, given the problem and the data
# The Bayesian network is represented as a dictionary of nodes and edges, where each node is a symbol and each edge is a conditional probability table (CPT)
# The CPT is represented as a nested dictionary, where the keys are the values of the parent nodes and the values are the probabilities of the child node
# For simplicity, we will assume that the prior and likelihood functions are uniform and independent, and that the marginal likelihood is constant
